# scalajs-mapbox
A Scala.js interface to [Mapbox](https://github.com/mapbox) and related APIs, like [Leaflet.js](https://github.com/Leaflet/Leaflet).


# What if a feature is missing?

APIs can change, even API's like [MPI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_Passing_Interface) (if barely). If you find a function or feature that is missing or can be improved, please submit a pull request. It is trivial to add most features, but we currently don't hae the time or inclination to support all features (especially if they aren't going to be used), so we are passing the buck on to our collective selves.

# Other libraries of interest

* [Autowire](https://github.com/lihaoyi/autowire) is a pair of macros that allows you to perform type-safe, reflection-free RPC between Scala systems (Scala-JS or Scala-JVM).
* [scalajs-google-maps](https://github.com/coreyauger/scalajs-google-maps) is a similar library but for Google Maps instead of the Mapbox ecosystem.
